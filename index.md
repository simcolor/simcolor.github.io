Hello! This is my barebone website, only a md file. I might as well use txt file as the website, but md sounds more professional. 

Since what I do mostly is just typing, I see no need to be fancy. 

I am going to keep a [blog](/blog/), but it is a bit weird to have everything written be exposed, all the history be recorded.
