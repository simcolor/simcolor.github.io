So sleepy today. spend 3 hours on making an exam, that nobody appreciates. 

Did some thinking on Ronkin function, spectral curve, limiting shape. But who knows, I will forget in a week, completely. Why bother? 

I need to write down stuff, every thing.

PG says, you should hide your thoughts, only talk to those that you trust. So that you can avoid censorship, the political correctness, the taboo. There is no explicit ban like in CN, but there is shunning. 

Is there a way to use hexo and online editing? That would make the site prettier. But I don't care anymore.
