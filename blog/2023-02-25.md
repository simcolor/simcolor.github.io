I went to have Jujitsu class (the last one) with O. Then, chatted with Danny a bit on the project. Then went to library, then took O to the beach while I did some skating. 

I guess I cannot upload pictures here. too bad. That's OK. it saves spaces when migrating. 

How about math formula? $a^2$ OK. good enough, cannot complain! 

It is just editing stuff in barecode is a bit cold. 

One can also have 'todo list' horray! :tada:
